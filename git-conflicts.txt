#### Trying to resolve git merge 'conflicts'

```
git checkout development   # in the branch development
git merge features/task123 # trying to get the code from 'features/task123' branch into 'development' branch 

CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in test.txt
Auto-merging test.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

# Abort the merge to get back how it was before running '$ git merge features/task123' on the 'development' branch
```
git merge --abort

```
