The git 'rebase' and 'merge' is similar

# creating a new branch from another
git checkout -b development master # creating 'development' branch from 'master' branch 

# check to the new branch just created 'development'
git checkout development

# add/change file contents on the 'development' branch 
echo "code 2" >> app.txt

# add and commit the changes
git add app.txt; git commit -m "new code changes on the development branch"

# Now use the git 'rebase'command
git checkout master
git rebase development
