Delete the "locally" and "remote" branch CMD:
The "-d" option will delete the branch only if it has already been pushed and merged with the remote branch. 
Use "-D" instead if you want to force the branch to be deleted, even if it hasn't been pushed or merged yet.

# delete branch locally
git branch -d localBranchName
  #or
git branch -D localBranchName

# delete branch remote
git push origin --delete remoteBranchName
  #or
git push origin :remoteBranchName


### For example: delete the remote 'TEST-123' branch

# checkout to another branch first i.e: git checkout dev
git push origin :TEST-123  #(delete the remote 'TEST-123' branch)


### For example: delete local 'TEST-123' branch
# checkot to another branch first i.e: git checkout dev
git branch -D TEST-123   #(delete the local 'TEST-123' branch)

After that no local branch nor remote branch named 'TEST-123' it will be unavailable!
